>> Candidate Tracking

Candidate Tracking's purpose is enabling small organizations the ability to manage and organize potential Candidates (for example, employees or members).

>> Users

Candidate Tracking has three basic types of users, as follows: an Administrator, a Tracker and a Candidate.

> An Administrator has the ability to create, read, update and delete Trackers as well as select the fields that all Candidates will be required to complete (for example, Name, CoverLetter, Resume and Location).  An Administrator will further have the ability to restrict the Trackers in their posting ability (for example, an Administrator of an organization doing business strictly out of Chicago, Illinois, United States can restrict Trackers from selecting London, England when posting Opportunities).  Administrators will additionally have all the abilities offered to both Trackers and Candidates.  Additionally, an Administrator may re-assign opportunities to a different Tracker.  Future functionality may enable the Administrator to CRUD new fields.

> A Tracker has the ability to create, read, update and delete opportunities.  Additionally, a Tracker may select certain fields as being required to be filled out by Candidates in excess of what the Administrator already requires (for example, if the Administrator requires a Name, Resume and Location, a Tracker can additionally required a CoverLetter).  Once an opportunity is created, it belongs to the Tracker who created it; however, an Administrator may opt to update ownership of an opportunity (this ability is not given to the individual Trackers).  For sake of responsibility, a Candidate will belong to a Tracker when applying to an opportunity owned by a given Tracker.  Additionally, a tracker will have all the abilities offered to candidates.

> A Candidate has the ability to create, read, update and delete their information as well as apply to opportunities.  A Candidates information will consist of (for example) their name, their address, their phone number, a resume, up to three cover letters and up to three other documents (for example, references or a writing sample).  In addition to being able to apply to opportunities, Candidates will be able to withdraw their application from opportunities.  By withdrawing, Candidates remove themselves from consideration for an opportunity; however, their application to the opportunity (as well as the information used to apply to the opportunity) is still known to Trackers and Administrators.
